# Binary-Tree

A simple binary search tree implementation in C++

## Rationale

I got bored one night and thought that I would write a simple application demonstrating a binary search tree. This one specifically only works with integers, but can easily be expanded to more data types since most of the code is already templated.

## Building

Clone the and `cd` into the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jarulsamy/binary-tree
    $ cd binary-tree

Create a build directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

Generate the cmake build files

    $ cmake ..

Finally, build:

    $ make

The binary will be built to `build/bin/btree.o` 

### Usage

    $  bin/btree.o ../data.txt
    Enter a number to find: 8268
    Found!
